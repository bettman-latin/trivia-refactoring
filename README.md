# trivia-refactoring

spend time figuring out how all the code worked

found and reduced duplication by creating functions for duplicated areas of code

reformated things like the _current_category_ function to reduce waste and to make more readable

After a few more little refactoring things, began to make classes

Decited to have 3 classes, player, questions, and game

the plater class housed all the player variables like name, place, purse...

the question class had lists of questions, and all functions that created and chose questions

the game class had a list of plater objects, some instance variables, and all the other functions to run the game including: roll, add player, asking questions, checking to see if player has won... just all the functios that will br run throughout the game

after classes were created and variables/calls were correctly linked, a few comments were added to give general info on what things do, and specific info on functions/lines that needed clarification
